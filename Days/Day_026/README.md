# Day 26

## RAG Indexing and Retrival

![100 days of code Day 26](https://github.com/GritinAI/100DaysofCodeGenerativeAI/blob/main/Images/Day26.png)Welcome to Day 26 of the 100 Days of Code challenge!

Welcome to Day 26 of the 100 Days of Code challenge!
Today, we’ll learn more about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)—an advanced technique that combines retrieval methods with generative models for more accurate and informed responses.

Learn and master Rag Indexing and Retrieval techniques to efficiently store, search, and retrieve data

Key Topics for Today:
RAG Indexing: Learn how to index data effectively to improve retrieval for generative models.
RAG Retrieval: Explore how relevant information is retrieved from indexed data to enhance the output of AI models.
